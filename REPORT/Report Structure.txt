Part A: Introduction and Background
	Chapter 1: Introduction to Domain
	Chapter 2: Background Domain Research


Part B: Methodology Setup


	Chapter 3: Project Management
		What PM methodology?
		Why - linking to context?
		Use of gantt chart? (Kanban/SCRUMBoard?)
			-For time management
			-Setting weekly objectives
			-Based on priority
			-Revised gantt chart half way through project to factor in new risks and issues with timings


	Chapter 4: Software Development Life Cycle
		How ensure all aims are met?
		What SE Methodology is most appropriate for context?
		Ensure system is fit for evaluation?
			-using hybrid of agile, where components are built off of each other


	Chapter 5: Methodology Planning
