Based on gut feeling, attempts were made to make a weighted background image
These all work how they should, however the results i do not know how to use.

I regressed to using a mode-based background from a 20 image startup function.


Background extraction was implemented and the foreground is obtained in testing setup.

Problems encountered in the startup of live experiments, where the sun and small movements effect the background. This results in rgb salt and pepper onn the image. Smoothing of this is being tested.
Swaying trees will always be a problem, as they are fixed structures which are always moving. Mode stacking will not detect the array of possibilities, just the most frequent one. 

An alternative method could be to use a weighting system:
	Where for each value of pixel A in the startup set
	Ordered in frequency the values which make up...
	...50% of the total values in the set. 
	Are added to an array. 
	This array is the background image.


Based on the literature reviewed so far, testing will be done on using edge-detecting for the background detection.
