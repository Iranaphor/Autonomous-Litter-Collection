TODO: Look through staff directory to see if there are any studentships available.


Next Steps:

- Build/Buy Robot Car

- Program Object Recognition System
which entails>?
	- Objects are so far isolated...
	- Next step is to identify each one individually...
	- How do we identify them then?
	- We first need to collect a load of information on them...
	- Such as:
		- Histogram Colour Distribution (using Intensity of HSI)
		- Eccentricity
			- But wait... this system is designed to identify litter most of ...
			- ...the time when thrown away or dropped, litter is squashed or ...
			- ... screwed up. Because of this, the shape is deformed, making ...
			- ... any shape based detection worthless.
			- Despite this, HCD would still work as it focuses on the colour ...
			- spectrum.
		- What other systems are there then?
			- We have colour-based; shape-based is a no-go; how about texture?
			- Entropy?
			
			
	- We also need to employ edge detection for the background extraction.
